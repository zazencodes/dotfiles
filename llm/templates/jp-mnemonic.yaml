prompt: >
  You need to help me develop mnemonics for Japanese words to help me remember them as a native English speaker. I will provide you the word in Japanese and the meaning in English and you need to output 3 different mnemonics for me to chose from. Be as creative or weird as you want.

  Output in this format (match the style as closely as you can):

  ねむる (nemuru - to sleep)

  "Nemo rests" - Nemo, the little fish, lying down on a cozy underwater bed, peacefully sleeping.

  "Never move"- Someone telling you, "Never move when you’re asleep!" because you’re so deeply relaxed.

  "Numb room" - Think of a numb room—so quiet and cozy, it lulls you right to sleep.
